I developed a straightforward statistical segmentation of brain scans taken by X-ray computed tomography (CT) of patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The most interesting part was to create predictors that mirrored what those who read scans actually perform mentally. We created a series of predictors such as spatially local means (means of the intensities of the image in a small neighborhood), spatially local variances and other moments.   The idea was to incorporate the fact those who read the scans take into account that other areas of the brain are similar on the image and those with high variances correspond to "edges" where the image has changes.  

The end goal was to determine the size of the hemorrhage, which has been shown to be dramatically predictive of whether a patient will have good outcomes at follow up times. Our results indicate that our method is highly accurate, with good sensitivity, specificity and overlap, with what a human reader would have determined (the gold standard). We compared the performance of random forests, standard logistic regression, logistic regression with an L1 penalty (like the LASSO), and using generalized additive models (GAMs).  Overall the performance was similar, but the best was when using random forests (with defaults).  All of the processing and analysis was implemented in R.
